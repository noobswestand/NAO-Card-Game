A simple shape game built with Python3 and openCV
The robot will ask for a specific shape, and will try its best to filter out all the background noise and see what shape you are holding
There are a couple of debugging variables that you can toggle
* RobotActive - if the robot shall be used for the test - if False, use your computer webcam
* sayWrong - if True, then if the robot sees the wrong shape, it will tell the user, and ask again
